# Installation

Before starting, you should make sure that

- You have created a [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) account
- R2 service is activated (requires payment method added to CF account) and at least one bucket is created
- (optional but recommended) KV & D1 instances are created.

This project can be de deployed to [Cloudflare Workers][] or [Cloudflare Pages][].The Workers is the new and recommanded way, but it requires you to manually input the Cloudflare resource (R2 / KV / D1) ids in the variables at this time. The Pages way is slightly simpler to configure as you can set the Cloudflare resource bindings directly in the dashboard, but lacks with some features.

## Deployment to Cloudflare Workers (recommended)

Fork this project and connect your fork with Cloudflare Workers. Cloudflare dashboard Settings:

- Build configuration:
  - Build command: `npm run build:all`
  - Deploy command: `npm run deploy`
  - Version command: `npm run cfversion`
  - Root directory: `/`
- Variables and Secrets: Set the following variables. (Any change take effect immediately)
  - `WEBDAV_USERNAME`: username.
  - `WEBDAV_PASSWORD` password.
  - (optional) `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` & `CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`. For access Clareflare Resources (Workers / R2 / KV / D1) usage statistics data.
    - `CF_ACCOUNT_ID`: Cloudflare Account ID. The uuid part of Cloudflare dashboard url, e.g. `https://dash.cloudflare.com/a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6` => `a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6` .
    - `CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`: Cloudflare API token of Analytics. Create one [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Use `Read analytics and logs` template.
  - (optional) global config keys: If `KV` is binded, these configs can be modified through Web UI, the env values (if any) are used as initial config.
    -  `PUBLIC_PREFIX`, `PUBLIC_DIR_PREFIX`, `PUBLIC_RWDIR_PREFIX`. Values of each variable are comma-separated "public" path prefixes. Pathes of these prefixes are allowed to be accessed (readonly / readonly with dir listing / writable) anonymously.
    -  `HARD_SHARE_EXPIRATION`: Flag. Set an `1` to enable share hard deletion mode: automatically delete the share KV object after expiration.
    -  `USE_FULL_SEARCH`: Flag. Set to `1` to use full search mode by default.
- Build - Variables and secrets. (Any change require re-build to take effect)
  - `R2_BUCKET_NAME` : The [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket name.
  - (optional) `KV_ID` : The [Cloudflare Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) instance id.
  - (optional) `DATABASE_ID` : The [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) database id.
    - Though `KV_ID` and `DATABASE_ID` are optional, we strongly recommand to set them, otherwise some features of this project won't work.
  - (optional) `SITENAME` : Site name. Default is `FlareDrive`.
  - (optional) `SHORT_SITENAME` : Short site name. Default is the same value as `SITENAME` variable.
  - (optional) `FAVICON_URL` : Custom site favicon (icon) image url. It's recommended to use an .png image of 512x512 size.
  - (optionL) `JS_URL` & `CSS_URL`: Custom JavaScript & CSS file url. If set, they will be injected in the `<head>` element of Web UI.
  - (optional) `DEBUG` : Flag. Set to `1` to enable Cloudflare Workers Logs.

## Deployment to Cloudflare Pages

Fork this project and connect your fork with Cloudflare Pages. Select `Vite` framework preset. Cloudflare dashboard Settings:

- Build command: `npm run build:all-pages`
- Build output: `dist`
- Build system version: Version 3.
- Variables and Secrets: See above (the Workers version) for meanings.
  - `WEBDAV_USERNAME`, `WEBDAV_PASSWORD`
  - (optional) `SITENAME`, `SHORT_SITENAME`, `FAVICON_URL`, `JS_URL`, `CSS_URL`, `PUBLIC_PREFIX`, `PUBLIC_DIR_PREFIX`, `PUBLIC_RWDIR_PREFIX`.
  - (optional) `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` & `CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`.
  - (optional) `WORKER_URL` & `WORKER_TOKEN` : The server side thumbnail generation feature uses [Cloudflare Images Resizing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/bindings/), which is only supported in Workers but not Pages. To use this feature in Pages deployment, you need to (manually) deploy `workers/forwarder.js` file to Cloudflare Worker (set the `TOKEN` variable), then set these variables to worker url & token.
- Bindings:
  - Bind R2 bucket to `BUCKET` name.
  - (optional) Bind Workers KV to `KV` name.
  - (optional) Bind D1 Database to `DB` name.
  - (optional) Use wrangler CLI to deploy `workers/reindexer-do.ts` to CF as [Durable Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) (bind `BUCKET` and `DB` to the deployed DO too), than bind the DO to `REINDEXER_DO` name. It's only required in Pages mode as CF pages don't support Durable Objects directly.

You need to retry deployment for any config changes to take effect.

# WebDAV endpoint

You can use WebDAV protocol to access your files.
Fill the endpoint URL as `https://<your-domain.com>/dav` and use the username and password you set.

However, the standard WebDAV protocol does not support large file (≥128MB) uploads due to the limitation of Cloudflare Workers.
You must upload large files through the web interface which supports chunked uploads.

The WebDAV endpoint is compatible with rclone [webdav](https://rclone.org/webdav/) backend's `owncloud` vendor, support md5 hashes. Example rclone config:

```
[flaredrive]
type = webdav
url = https://flaredrive.example.com/dav/ # replace with your domain
vendor = owncloud
user = root # WEBDAV_USERNAME
pass = obscured_password # rclone obscure <WEBDAV_PASSWORD>
encoding = None
```

# CGI feature

CGI feature use [LiquidJS][] template engine to render a `.cgi` file and serve rendered contents.
It works on published links (`/s/*`) only, you also need to tick `Enable CGI` checkbox in publish dialog.
It recognizes `index.cgi` as dir index file automatically.
Also, if `404.cgi` in share root dir exists, it will be used as fallback if current requested path file doesn't exist.
Currently only GET method is supported. The template receives `{ request, env }` as initial context;
the `request` is the current http request sent by the user browser;
the `env` (`Record<string, string>` type) environment variables can be configured in publish dialog.

Several custom tags are available:

- `{% set_header "Content-Type: text/plain" %}` : Set response http header.
- `{% set_header "Status" 404 %}` : Set response status code.
- `{% fetch "variableName" "url" %}` : fetch a url and store response as `{status, headers, body, data}` in `variableName` context variable. The `body` is raw response body string; the `data` is response body parsed object if it's a valid json.

Available custom filters:

- `json_parse`: Parse a string as JavaScript literal to object. The string doesn't need to be strict json. E.g. `{% assign my_obj = '{id: 1, name: "Item"}' | json_parse %}`.
- `query_string` : Parse a url query string or a full url and return query variable value. E.g. `{% assign bar = 'https://example.com/?foo=a&bar=b' | query_string: "bar" %}`.
- `{{ "123456" | md5sum }}` : Calculate the md5 sum.
- `{{ "example.com" | nslookup}}` : Do a DNS query and return result object json. It accepts two optional parameters:
  - type: defaults to `A`. E.g. `{{ "example.com" | nslookup: "AAAA"}}`.
  - boolean flag to allow returning result (instead of throwing exception directly) even if the DNS query failed.

Example `example.cgi` contents:

```
{%-  fetch "todoItem" "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1" -%}
{%-  set_header "Content-Type: text/html" -%}

<h1>Async Fetch Test</h1>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Todo ID: {{ todoItem.data.id }}</h3>
  <p>Title: {{ todoItem.data.title }}</p>
  <p>Completed: {{ todoItem.data.completed }}</p>
</div>
```

Rendered contents:

```html
<h1>Async Fetch Test</h1>
<div class="card">
  <h3>Todo ID: 1</h3>
  <p>Title: delectus aut autem</p>
  <p>Completed: false</p>
</div>
```

# Development

Prepare development environment:

1. Run `npm i`.
2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and modify it to set environment variables. (Note: `.env.local` is used by Vite. Cloudflare Wrangler only recognizes `.dev.vars` file, running `npm run build` will automatically copy the former to the latter)
3. Copy `wrangler.sample.toml` (Running as Workers) or `wrangler.example-pages.toml` (Running as Pages) to `wrangler.toml`.
4. Run `npm run cfdevmigrations` to apply local D1 database [migrations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/reference/migrations/), which are defined inside `migrations/` folder.
5. Run `npm run codegen` to generate `graphql/generated/*.ts` files from `graphql/*.graphql` source files.

## Run this project locally as Workers

1. Run `npm run build:worker` to build worker dist file. Each time you modify the source files of `functions/*` or `lib/*`, you must re-run this build command. No watcher is available at this time.
2. Run `npm run cfdev` in terminal to start the wrangler Workers backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.
3. Run `npm start` in another terminal to start [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) dev server at `http://localhost:5173/`. It will proxy API requests and forward them to wrangler backend automatically.

Open `http://localhost:5173/` in browser and it's done.

## Run this project locally as Pages

1. Run `npm run cfpagesdev` in terminal to start the wrangler Pages "functions" backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. Wrangler should watch source file changes and restart itself automatically.
2. Run `npm start` in another terminal to start [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) dev server at `http://localhost:5173/`.

Same as above, open `http://localhost:5173/` in browser and it's done.
